                <p> Drishyam 2(Malyalam)

                    Hats off to the writer director JEETU JOSEPH for coming up with this mystery thriller which stitched so well as the sequel to Drishyam with Unexpected twists , the complete build up of suspense & thrill keeping you at the edge of your seat. The !dea of male protagnist played by Mohan Lal who is always ahead of everyone in every possible way and he proves it towards the climax just gives you rush of adrenaline out of the suprising excitement . The Climax just makes you go Woow , though not as jaw dropping as the 1st part but still gets you super excited with thrill . There are very rare film sequels where you feel SEQUEL HO TOH AISA and this film falls in that category. Only Drawback of the film is its runtime the film could have been cut short as there is a little lag & drag jn the 1st half . But the film magically picks up with double power as the tension in film builds up and things unviel. Actors have done terrific job especially Mohanlal who has lived the character with such ease . A must watch & a worth watch movie .</p>

                <p> Far from Home: The Adventures of Yellow Dog is a 1995 family adventure drama in which a boy and his dog must fend for themselves in the wilderness after a shipwreck. Spoiler alert: For more sensitive viewers -- especially those who love dogs -- the scene in which the dog is left behind in the wilderness after the tween boy is rescued by the search party might be a bit much to take. There are also some moments of peril, including the boat wreck, an interaction between the boy and dog with a wildcat, and a scene in which the tween breaks his arm during a fall down a hill. The dog also falls off of a makeshift bridge but survives. "Crap" is used by a young boy. Overall, the movie imparts lessons on survival as the tween boy applies the lessons taught by his father earlier in the movie.

According to Telegraph World, the company makes 60 billion blocks a year. While LEGO want to replace the harmful plastic used in their products, they also require the new material to meet the high standards that allow the blocks to work as they always have, especially with the effective “clicking” together is a key aspect of the iconic coloured block. </p>
